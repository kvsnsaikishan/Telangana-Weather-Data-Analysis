# 🌦️ Telangana State Weather Data Analysis (2021–2024)

### **Power BI Dashboard Project**

This project presents a full weather analytics study of Telangana using **Power BI**, covering **Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed** trends across **36 districts** and **585 mandals** from **2021 to 2024**.

The goal of this project is to turn raw weather data into meaningful insights that can help citizens, farmers, researchers, and policymakers understand climatic patterns and changes in Telangana.

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This Power BI solution integrates multi-year weather data and provides interactive dashboards that showcase:

* District-wise and mandal-wise weather behavior
* Seasonal, monthly, and yearly climate patterns
* Extreme weather zones (high rainfall, high temperature, low humidity, etc.)
* Insights into climate variability over 4 years

Each dashboard is designed for clear storytelling, drill-down analysis, and quick interpretation.

## 🗂️ **Dashboards Included**

### **1️⃣ Rainfall Dashboard**

* Average Rainfall (mm) by District
* Monthly Rainfall Distribution
* Season-wise Rainfall Contribution
* Rain Trend by District & Year
* High Rainfall Districts Visualization
* Total Coverage: **36 districts** & **585 mandals**

**Key Insights:**

* Monsoon contributes ~70% of the total annual rainfall
* July–August are peak rainfall months
* Warangal & Nizamabad show consistently higher precipitation

---

### **2️⃣ Temperature Insights**

* Avg Min & Max Temperature by District
* Seasonal Heat Pattern (Summer, Monsoon, Winter)
* Yearly Temperature Trends (2021–2024)
* Monthly Temperature Comparison
* Mandal-wise Heat Variation

**Key Insights:**

* May is the hottest month every year
* Slight temperature increase in 2024
* Summer shows the highest temperature spikes

---

### **3️⃣ Humidity Patterns**

* Avg Max & Min Humidity (%) by District
* Yearly Humidity Change
* Seasonal Humidity Behavior
* Mandal-wise Humidity Distribution
* District-level filter panel

**Key Insights:**

* Humidity peaks during monsoon (~90–95%)
* 2024 shows a drop in minimum humidity → signs of drier weather
* Forest regions maintain higher moisture levels

---

### **4️⃣ Wind Speed Analysis**

* Average Min/Max Wind Speed (Kmph) by District
* Yearly Wind Speed Trend
* Mandal-wise Wind Variation
* Monthly Wind Speed Line Charts
* Multi-district comparison panel

**Key Insights:**

* Highest wind speeds occur during early monsoon
* Certain regions like Rangareddy show noticeable wind variability
* Wind speeds stabilize during winter

---

## 🔧 **Tools & Technologies Used**

* **Power BI** (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualization)
* **Power Query** (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
* **Excel Dataset** (Source files)
* **Visualization Techniques**: Line charts, bar charts, slicers, cards, multi-row visuals, drill-downs

## 📘 **How the Project Was Built**

### **1️⃣ Data Collection**

* Gathered Telangana weather data (district & mandal level)
* Combined and formatted yearly datasets from 2021 to 2024

### **2️⃣ Data Cleaning (Power Query)**

* Removed duplicates
* Handled missing values
* Standardized date fields
* Converted metrics into correct numerical formats

### **3️⃣ Data Modeling**

* Created relationships between

  * District
  * Mandal
  * Year
  * Season
  * Weather metrics
* Ensured correct aggregation behavior

### **4️⃣ Dashboard Designing**

* Four dashboards created with a unified layout
* Added slicers and filters for advanced exploration
* Made visuals interactive and user-friendly

### **5️⃣ Insights Extraction**

* Identified seasonal patterns
* Compared year-to-year shifts
* Detected climate irregularities and trends
